# Contributing to Myra UI Generator

First off, **thank you** for considering contributing! I truly believe in open source and the power of community collaboration. Unlike many repositories, I actively welcome contributions of all kinds - from bug fixes to new features.

## My Promise to Contributors

- **I will respond to every PR and issue** - I guarantee feedback on all contributions
- **Bug fixes are obvious accepts** - If it fixes a bug, it's getting merged
- **New features are welcome** - I'm genuinely open to new ideas and enhancements
- **Direct line of communication** - If I'm not responding to a PR or issue, email me directly at johnvondrashek@gmail.com

## How to Contribute

### Bug Fixes

Found a bug? Fix it and submit a PR. Bug fixes are the easiest contributions to accept:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix`
3. Make your fix
4. Submit a PR

That's it. If it fixes a real bug, it's getting merged.

### New Features

Have an idea for a new feature? I want to hear it:

- **New widget types** - Myra has many widgets; help expand coverage
- **Configuration options** - Better customization for different project setups
- **Documentation improvements** - Examples, clarifications, tutorials
- **Performance enhancements** - Make the generator faster or more efficient
